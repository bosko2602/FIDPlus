	'Agility_desc':			'Agility is how how well a footballer can move their body and it\'s different parts (legs, arms etc.) fluently and quickly. This is a basic attribute used in many situations and an agile footballers also tend to be better in making quick turns and changes of directions than less agile footballers.',
	
	'Balance_desc':			'Balance is mainly the attribute that decides how well a footballer can keep their balance while interacting with a ball which reaches them at a height that is above their waist but, of course, it also affects their ability to keep balance overall. A footballer with good balance can keep their balance even when things get rough while a footballer with bad balance may falter and lose out in contests with other footballers due to them loosing his balance.',
	
	'Jumping_desc':			'Jumping is the attribute that decides how well a footballer is at getting up into the air and how well the footballer can time the jump in order to receive the ball or perform headers in the best possible way. A good jumper therefore naturally has advantages when fighting for or interacting with a ball in the air.',
	
	'Speed_desc':			'Speed is the most important attribute when deciding the possible maximum speed of a footballer and thereby the most important attribute when deciding how much a footballer can move each turn.',
	
	'Stamina_desc':			'A footballer with high stamina can perform to a high level all the game while a footballer with less stamina will probably get tired and start to underperform towards the end of the matches. Good stamina is a key skill for players who run a lot and perform many actions during a match.',
	
	'Strength_desc':		'Strength is the amount of physical strength that a footballer possesses. A high level of Strength gives the footballer an advantage when facing weaker opponents in physical encounters and is of course one of the key skill for footballers who expect to beat the opponents when fighting for the ball.',
	
	'Ball Cont._desc':		'Ball Control is how well a footballer can control the ball with their feet and can be described as having a deft and natural touch of the ball. It is a basic attribute that comes into play in many situations.',
	
	'Blocking_desc':		'The Blocking attribute decides how good a footballer is at “making themselves as big as possible”, but also how good the footballer is at simply getting in the way for the ball in any way and thereby hindering a ball from reaching it\'s target. Normal targets for blocks are passes and shots, but also bad rebounds and any other loose ball can blocked if needed and if the blocking skills are good enough. This a key skill when it is of great importance to stop the ball from reaching its intended target and other interactions with the ball are impossible.',
	
	'Curving_desc':			'Curving is an attribute that is related to how well a footballer can hit the ball (passing or shooting) “around” their opponents with their feet. A good “curver” has a greater chance of making a pass or shot that is difficult to intercept or stop by their opponents. This attribute is especially important when performing crosses and a footballer with good curving skills is the kind of player who can make those beautiful passes and shots that seems to be controlled by remote control.',
	
	'Dribble_desc':			'Dribbling is the main attribute that decides how well the footballer can dribble. A good dribbler can create space for themselves by beating their opponents with feints and tricks, and by moving their body and the ball, thereby making it difficult for their opponent to take the ball from them. A dribble can be performed when a footballer have the ball under their control and then moves or simply holds onto the ball while their opponents tries to steal the ball from them by performing a tackle.',
	
	'High Pas._desc':		'The High Passing attribute is the main influence in how accurately a footballer can pass the ball when performing a high pass.

	'Low Pas._desc':		'The Low Passing attribute is the main influence for how accurately a footballer can pass the ball when performing a low pass. A footballer with good low passing skills will be able to hit those hard, fast and accurate low passes that are so important when you find a narrow gap between opponents and need to get the passes precise in order to avoid them being able to interact with the pass. A less skilled footballer may well fail with the accuracy in these cases and give the ball away for the opponents to make an easy interception.',
	
	'One touch_desc':		'One Touch is the skill that determines the footballers ability to predict and identify the intended target (by a pass, header or shot) while at the same time calculating/anticipating how to interact with the incoming ball in order to reach that target. One touch is therefore the attribute that increases chances of performing a good direct pass (by foot or head). A footballer that is highly skilled in the art of one touch play can perform direct passes just as good as they would have been able to do if he had received the ball first. This is a passing skill that is typical for a play-maker type of footballer where being able to direct passes is a big advantage. The one touch attribute is also used when the footballer tries to perform direct actions on goal such as direct shots or headers and can also therefore be a very useful skill for forwards.',
	
	'Tackling_desc':		'Tackling is the attribute which is a main decider in how well a footballer can take the ball from an opponent during a move. A good tackler also has a lower risk of causing a foul when trying to tackle. A good tackler is skilled not only in reading what the opponent with the ball intends to do when trying to dribble the tackling footballer but alsoin the technique of how to actually take the ball from the opponent. It may be a brute-force sliding tackle, a well-timed steal when the opponent let the ball too far away, or it can be a well-timed shoulder tackle. ',
	
	'Anticipation_desc':	'Anticipation is how well a footballer can predict the ball trajectory/path and thereby helps the footballer to choose better positions on the pitch compared to the opponents with less anticipation. It is therefore a basic skill useful in many situations related to receiving and performing direct actions.',
	
	'Def. Pos._desc':		'Defensive Positioning skill is how well a footballer can position themselves in relation to their opponents when being in a defensive situation. It increases their chances of winning physical encounters due to having positioned their body “more cleverly” than an opponent who is not a good positional player. Defensive Positioning is one of the key skills in physical encounters in and around the footballers own penalty area where it is of great importance to keep the ball away from the opponents.',
	
	'Fearl._desc':			'Fearlessness is the attribute that decides how much fear a footballer experiences during physical encounters but also the fear a footballer experiences in some situations where there is big risk of getting knocks and bruises. If a footballer feels a high degree of fear, it will hinder them from performing well in these situations.',
	
	'Scor. Pos._desc':		'The Scoring Positioning skill is how well a footballer can position themselves in relation to their opponents when being in an offensive situation. It increases their chances of winning physical encounters due to having positioned their body “more cleverly” than an opponent who is not a good position player. Scoring Positioning is one of the key skills in physical encounters in and around the opponents penalty area where there is a good chance of scoring if the ball can be won.',
	
	'Vision_desc':			'Vision is a general skill that improves a footballers passing ability and accuracy. A high level of vision gives the footballer a bigger possibility to perform passes that are difficult for the opposition to intercept but easy for the teammates just because the footballer can see where their teammates wants the ball and where the opponents do not want the ball to be hit.',
	
	'Heading_desc':			'Heading is an attribute that is related to how well a footballer can hit the ball (passing or shooting) with their head. A good header of the ball can control the headers well and can make accurate, powerful and well timed headers. The attribute will therefore have an impact on the accuracy as well as the ability to perform a pass or shot (with head) that is difficult to intercept or stop for their opponents. The heading attribute is always used when performing a direct pass or direct shot when the ball is above a footballer\'s waist (yellow on the ballpath).',
	
	'Sh. Acc._desc':		'Shooting Accuracy is the footballers ability to hit where they are aiming when taking a shot and how well a footballer strikes the ball when performing a shot. A footballer with good Shooting accuracy is not only more reliable in their accuracy but also gets less mishits.',
	
	'Shoot. Str._desc':		'Shooting Strength is how hard a footballer can shoot overall. It can be described as how good the shooting technique of the footballer is and it is not only affecting the maximum power of the shots but also how hard a footballer can shoot without losing the precision. A footballer with a strong shot will be able to perform shots that are more difficult for the opposing keeper or player to stop solely because of the power of the shot.',
	
	'Aerial Ab._desc':		'Aerial Ability decides a goalkeepers ability to handle situations where they have to fight for and intercept a ball in situations where the ball is in the air.',
	
	'Handling_desc':		'Handling is the skill that decides how well a keeper handles the ball with their hands and how well the keeper can hold onto the ball when saving.',
	
	'Keep. Pos._desc':		'The Keeper Positioning skill is how well a goalkeeper can position their body in order to have the most advantageous position for performing any of their keeper actions.',
	
	'P. w. Hands_desc':		'Passing with hands is the attribute that decides how well a goalkeeper can pass a ball using their hands but it also affects how good the goalkeeper is in directing tough shots away from the goal instead of into the goal.',
	
	'Reflexes_desc':		'Reflexes is the skill that decides how quickly a goalkeeper can react when trying to save a shot.',
